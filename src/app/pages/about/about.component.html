            My name is Marcello Munari, I live in Turin ,Italy and I’m a travel photographer. Thanks to my passion for
            writing and adventurous journeys, I describe through words and images what I see but most important what I
            feel. The later it gets, the more I realize that there is too much to see on this planet to sit on my butt
            and don’t go out there and explore every corner!(although the Earth is round).Ever since I started
            travelling, I saw its power, I tasted that sensation of freedom, that feeling that pushes you to <strong>
            discover more </strong>, to <strong>see more </strong> and to <strong>learn more</strong>. This allowed me
            to grow and to expand my boundaries. I want to use photography and my stories as a means of communication,
            to ensure that people see right through my eyes and be inspired.

            We should remind ourselves these words more often:
            <br>
            “Keep your thoughts positive, because your thoughts become your words.
            <br>
            Keep your words positive, because your words become your behavior.
            <br>
            Keep your behavior positive, because your behaviors become your habits.
            <br>
            Keep your habits positive, because your habits become your values.
            <br>
            Keep your values positive, because your values become your destiny.”
            <br>
